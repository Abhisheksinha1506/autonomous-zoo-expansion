# Symbiosis Repo — Files with interdependent survival relationships

## 📖 The Analogy

> Files that need each other to survive—kill one, and its partner dies too, like bees and flowers.

> **Self-evolving repository implementing Symbiosis Repo**

## 🧠 Mathematical Concept

**Symbiosis - close ecological relationships between different species**

This repository implements this concept autonomously, evolving daily without human intervention.

## 🎯 What This Does

Every day, the repository evolves according to the mathematical rules defined in `evolve.py`.

## 📊 Current State

- **Generation**: Check `state.json`
- **Evolution Log**: See `evolution_log.md`

## 🚀 Running Locally

```bash
python evolve.py  # Run one evolution step
```

## 📖 Layman Explanation

"Files that need each other to survive—kill one, and its partner dies too, like bees and flowers."

## 🔬 Technical Details

- **Algorithm**: Implemented in `evolve.py`
- **State Management**: `state.json`
- **Determinism**: Date-based randomness

## 📈 Evolution Log

See [evolution_log.md](evolution_log.md) for the complete evolution timeline.

## 🛠️ Technical Anatomy

- **DNA**: [evolve.py](evolve.py) (The instructions for life)
- **Vital Signs**: [state.json](state.json) (Current memory and state)
