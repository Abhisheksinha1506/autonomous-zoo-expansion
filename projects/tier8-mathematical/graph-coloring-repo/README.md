# Graph Coloring Repo — Ensuring proper graph coloring of file dependencies

## 📢 Latest Status
<!-- LATEST_STATUS_START -->
*Generation 121 complete: The system achieved a stable equilibrium. (2026-02-20 20:53)*
<!-- LATEST_STATUS_END -->

## 📖 The Analogy

> Like coloring a map so no two touching countries have the same color—except with code files.

> **Self-evolving repository implementing Graph Coloring Repo**

## 🧠 Mathematical Concept

**Graph Coloring - assigning colors to vertices so no adjacent vertices share the same color**

This repository implements this concept autonomously. Instead of a human programmer making decisions, the system follows these mathematical laws to reorganize itself over time.

## 🎯 What This Does

Every day, the repository breathes:
1. **Scanning**: It looks at the current state in [state.json](state.json).
2. **Calculating**: It applies the Graph Coloring Repo rules to decide what happens next.
3. **Evolving**: It creates or deletes files in the [data/](data/) directory.
4. **Reporting**: It updates this README and logs the progress in [evolution_log.md](evolution_log.md).

## 🚀 Running Locally

```bash
python evolve.py  # Run one evolution step manually
```

## 📖 Non-Technical Explanation
Like coloring a map so no two touching countries have the same color—except with code files. This means the repository isn't just static code—it's a living system where files interact, compete, or grow according to rules, just like plants in a garden or planets in orbit.

## ✨ Expected Output
A network of files and imports that are automatically tagged or 'colored' to avoid rule conflicts.

## 💎 Why it matters (Usefulness)
Demonstrates Constraint Satisfaction. It's the logic used to schedule airline flights or cellular network frequencies.

## 🔬 Technical Details

- **Algorithm**: Deterministic implementation of Graph Coloring Repo
- **State**: Persistent JSON storage for continuity
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions (runs every hour)
