# Prime Commit Filter — The Selective Bouncer

## 📖 The Analogy

> Think of this repo as a VIP club that only admits prime-numbered guests. Every commit's hash gets converted to a number—if it's prime, the commit stays.

> **Self-evolving repository implementing Prime Commit Filter**

## 🧠 Mathematical Concept

**Prime Numbers - integers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.**

This repository implements this concept autonomously. Instead of a human programmer making decisions, the system follows these mathematical laws to reorganize itself over time.

## 🎯 What This Does

Every day, the repository breathes:
1. **Scanning**: It looks at the current state in [state.json](state.json).
2. **Calculating**: It applies the Prime Commit Filter rules to decide what happens next.
3. **Evolving**: It creates or deletes files in the [data/](data/) directory.
4. **Reporting**: It updates this README and logs the progress in [evolution_log.md](evolution_log.md).

## 🚀 Running Locally

```bash
python evolve.py  # Run one evolution step manually
```

## 📖 Non-Technical Explanation
Think of this repo as a VIP club that only admits prime-numbered guests. Every commit's hash gets converted to a number—if it's prime, the commit stays. This means the repository isn't just static code—it's a living system where files interact, compete, or grow according to rules, just like plants in a garden or planets in orbit.

## ✨ Expected Output
A commit history where every single change is mathematically 'lucky'.

## 💎 Why it matters (Usefulness)
Demonstrates Filter-based Selection. It shows how strict rules can create a 'pure' environment.

## 🔬 Technical Details

- **Algorithm**: Deterministic implementation of Prime Commit Filter
- **State**: Persistent JSON storage for continuity
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions (runs every hour)
