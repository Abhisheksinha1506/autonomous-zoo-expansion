# Palindrome Commit Detector — Celebrating palindromic commit hashes

## 📢 Latest Status
<!-- LATEST_STATUS_START -->
*Generation 63 complete: A minor fluctuation was absorbed into the structure. (2026-02-06 20:57)*
<!-- LATEST_STATUS_END -->

## 📖 The Analogy

> A repo that celebrates when commit hashes read the same forwards and backwards, like 'racecar'.

> **Self-evolving repository implementing Palindrome Commit Detector**

## 🧠 Mathematical Concept

**Palindromes - sequences that read the same forwards and backwards**

This repository implements this concept autonomously. Instead of a human programmer making decisions, the system follows these mathematical laws to reorganize itself over time.

## 🎯 What This Does

Every day, the repository breathes:
1. **Scanning**: It looks at the current state in [state.json](state.json).
2. **Calculating**: It applies the Palindrome Commit Detector rules to decide what happens next.
3. **Evolving**: It creates or deletes files in the [data/](data/) directory.
4. **Reporting**: It updates this README and logs the progress in [evolution_log.md](evolution_log.md).

## 🚀 Running Locally

```bash
python evolve.py  # Run one evolution step manually
```

## 📖 Non-Technical Explanation
A repo that celebrates when commit hashes read the same forwards and backwards, like 'racecar'. This means the repository isn't just static code—it's a living system where files interact, compete, or grow according to rules, just like plants in a garden or planets in orbit.

## ✨ Expected Output
Highlighting and preserving changes that have perfectly symmetric digital fingerprints.

## 💎 Why it matters (Usefulness)
Demonstrates Pattern Recognition. It shows how a system can find meaning and order within random data.

## 🔬 Technical Details

- **Algorithm**: Deterministic implementation of Palindrome Commit Detector
- **State**: Persistent JSON storage for continuity
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions (runs every hour)
