## 📖 The Analogy

> Files drift through directories like weather systems—chaotic yet beautifully patterned.

> **Self-evolving repository implementing Lorenz Attractor File Drift**

## 🧠 Mathematical Concept

**Lorenz Attractor - chaotic system with butterfly-wing shaped strange attractor**

This repository implements this concept autonomously. Instead of a human programmer making decisions, the system follows these mathematical laws to reorganize itself over time.

## 🎯 What This Does

Every day, the repository breathes:
1. **Scanning**: It looks at the current state in [state.json](state.json).
2. **Calculating**: It applies the Lorenz Attractor File Drift rules to decide what happens next.
3. **Evolving**: It creates or deletes files in the [data/](data/) directory.
4. **Reporting**: It updates this README and logs the progress in [evolution_log.md](evolution_log.md).

## 🚀 Running Locally

```bash
python evolve.py  # Run one evolution step manually
```

## 📖 Non-Technical Explanation
Files drift through directories like weather systems—chaotic yet beautifully patterned. This means the repository isn't just static code—it's a living system where files interact, compete, or grow according to rules, just like plants in a garden or planets in orbit.

## ✨ Expected Output
Files jumping between directories in a chaotic 'butterfly' pattern.

## 💎 Why it matters (Usefulness)
Demonstrates Chaos Theory. It shows how tiny changes can lead to big, unpredictable (but organized) outcomes.

## 🔬 Technical Details

- **Algorithm**: Deterministic implementation of Lorenz Attractor File Drift
- **State**: Persistent JSON storage for continuity
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions (runs every hour)
