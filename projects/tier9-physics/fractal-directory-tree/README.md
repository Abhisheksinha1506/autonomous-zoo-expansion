## 📖 The Analogy

> A tree that grows smaller copies of itself infinitely, like looking into infinite mirrors.

> **Self-evolving repository implementing Fractal Directory Tree**

## 🧠 Mathematical Concept

**Fractal Geometry - self-similar patterns at every scale**

This repository implements this concept autonomously. Instead of a human programmer making decisions, the system follows these mathematical laws to reorganize itself over time.

## 🎯 What This Does

Every day, the repository breathes:
1. **Scanning**: It looks at the current state in [state.json](state.json).
2. **Calculating**: It applies the Fractal Directory Tree rules to decide what happens next.
3. **Evolving**: It creates or deletes files in the [data/](data/) directory.
4. **Reporting**: It updates this README and logs the progress in [evolution_log.md](evolution_log.md).

## 🚀 Running Locally

```bash
python evolve.py  # Run one evolution step manually
```

## 📖 Non-Technical Explanation
A tree that grows smaller copies of itself infinitely, like looking into infinite mirrors. This means the repository isn't just static code—it's a living system where files interact, compete, or grow according to rules, just like plants in a garden or planets in orbit.

## ✨ Expected Output
A self-similar hierarchy of directories that looks the same no matter how deep you zoom.

## 💎 Why it matters (Usefulness)
Demonstrates Recursion & Self-Similarity. It's the math behind coastlines, mountaintops, and broccoli.

## 🔬 Technical Details

- **Algorithm**: Deterministic implementation of Fractal Directory Tree
- **State**: Persistent JSON storage for continuity
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions (runs every hour)
