# 🧬 The Autonomous Zoo - Expansion Pack

> **15 New Self-Evolving Mathematical Organisms**

Welcome to the **Autonomous Zoo Expansion** — a new collection of 15 unique GitHub repositories that evolve autonomously through mathematical principles. Each "organism" runs daily without human intervention, exploring advanced mathematical concepts, physical dynamics, biological systems, and graph algorithms.

---

## 🌟 Philosophy

These repositories continue the legacy of autonomous code. They are **digital life forms** that:
- **Self-modify** their own structure based on mathematical rules
- **Commit changes** automatically via GitHub Actions
- **Explore** mathematical landscapes
- **Emerge** complex behavior from simple algorithms

Each project is a **proof of concept** that code can be beautiful, autonomous, and educational.

## 📊 The Complete Catalog

### 🧮 Tier 8: Mathematical Evolution (5 projects)

| Rank | Project | Core Theory | Autonomy | Layman Explanation |
|:----:|---------|-------------|:--------:|-------------------| 
| **#1** | [**Prime Commit Filter**](projects/tier8-mathematical/prime-commit-filter/) | Number Theory | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | "A bouncer who only lets prime-numbered commits into the club, kicking out all the composite ones." |
| **#2** | [**Fibonacci File Growth**](projects/tier8-mathematical/fibonacci-file-growth/) | Fibonacci Sequence | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | "Files multiply like rabbits—each generation equals the sum of the previous two." |
| **#3** | [**Modulo Mutation Engine**](projects/tier8-mathematical/modulo-mutation-engine/) | Modular Arithmetic | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | "A clock that resets mutations—every 12th hour, everything changes in a predictable cycle." |
| **#4** | [**Graph Coloring Repo**](projects/tier8-mathematical/graph-coloring-repo/) | Graph Theory | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | "Like coloring a map so no two touching countries have the same color—except with code files." |
| **#5** | [**Palindrome Commit Detector**](projects/tier8-mathematical/palindrome-commit-detector/) | Pattern Recognition | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | "A repo that celebrates when commit hashes read the same forwards and backwards, like 'racecar'." |

### ⚛️ Tier 9: Physical Dynamics (5 projects)

| Rank | Project | Core Theory | Autonomy | Layman Explanation |
|:----:|---------|-------------|:--------:|-------------------|
| **#6** | [**Lorenz Attractor File Drift**](projects/tier9-physics/lorenz-attractor-drift/) | Chaos Theory | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | "Files drift through directories like weather systems—chaotic yet beautifully patterned." |
| **#7** | [**Pendulum Repo Oscillator**](projects/tier9-physics/pendulum-oscillator/) | Harmonic Motion | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | "Files swing back and forth between folders like a grandfather clock, forever." |
| **#8** | [**Entropy Clock**](projects/tier9-physics/entropy-clock/) | Thermodynamics | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | "The universe winding down—each day the repo gets messier, approaching maximum disorder." |
| **#9** | [**Ising Model Repo**](projects/tier9-physics/ising-model/) | Statistical Mechanics | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | "Files like magnets—they align with neighbors or flip opposite, creating magnetic domains." |
| **#10** | [**Fractal Directory Tree**](projects/tier9-physics/fractal-directory-tree/) | Fractal Geometry | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | "A tree that grows smaller copies of itself infinitely, like looking into infinite mirrors." |

### 🧬 Tier 10: Biological Systems (4 projects)

| Rank | Project | Core Theory | Autonomy | Layman Explanation |
|:----:|---------|-------------|:--------:|-------------------|
| **#11** | [**DNA-Encoded Repo**](projects/tier10-biological/dna-encoded-repo/) | Genetics | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | "Files are DNA strands—mutations happen, genes duplicate, evolution occurs over generations." |
| **#12** | [**Darwinian File Selection**](projects/tier10-biological/darwinian-file-selection/) | Natural Selection | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | "Survival of the fittest—only the strongest, most 'fit' files survive each generation." |
| **#13** | [**Symbiosis Repo**](projects/tier10-biological/symbiosis-repo/) | Ecology | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | "Files that need each other to survive—kill one, and its partner dies too, like bees and flowers." |
| **#14** | [**Predator-Prey Dynamics**](projects/tier10-biological/predator-prey-dynamics/) | Population Dynamics | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | "Wolves and rabbits—predator files hunt prey files, populations oscillate in endless cycles." |

### 📊 Tier 11: Graph Algorithms (1 project)

| Rank | Project | Core Theory | Autonomy | Layman Explanation |
|:----:|---------|-------------|:--------:|-------------------|
| **#15** | [**PageRank File Importance**](projects/tier11-graph/pagerank-file-importance/) | Network Analysis | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | "Google's ranking algorithm for files—important files get promoted, obscure ones deleted." |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Explore a Project

Each project is self-contained in its own directory:

```bash
cd projects/tier8-mathematical/prime-commit-filter/
cat README.md  # Read the project documentation
python evolve.py  # Run one evolution step manually
```

### Watch Evolution Live

All projects have GitHub Actions configured to run daily. Check the commit history to see autonomous evolution in action!
